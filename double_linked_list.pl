% A circular double linked list
% =============================

% Always have a unused-cell at the beginning.

% I do not always inline unifications because the head is then more readable for users who don't need to know the details.

% Due to lack of modules in hProlog, the following predicate names should not be used elsewhere:
% - the heads of all following rules (starting with dll_, I reserve "the namespace"!)

% dll_cell(Element,Next,Previous)

% The following is perhaps odd:
%
%   Next link = more to the front (the left)
%   Previous link = more to the back (the right)
%
%   List structure
%   --------------
%   front-of-the-list | ... | back-of-the-list
