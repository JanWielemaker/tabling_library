% Notes about testing:
% - name of a test should start with t_, optionally followed by a number
% (starting from 1), and followed by the name of the predicate it tests.
% - TODO: exceptions to this rule exist.
% - fully automated tests are marked with autotest(<<test_name>>).
% - for now, nothing is done with the autotest facts.
