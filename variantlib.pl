% Variant/2
% Does not behave as I (personally) would expect on p(X,Y) and p(X,Z).
% In SWI-Prolog:
%   benoit we02c131 tabling$ swipl
%   ...
%   ?- variant(p(X,Y),p(X,Z)).
%   true.
% This version in hProlog:
%   ?- variant(p(X,Y),p(X,Z)).
%   No more!
%   The cause seems to be numbervars:
%   ?- numbervars(p(X,Y),0,N),numbervars(p(X,Z),0,M).
%   M = 1
%   Z = X = A
%   N = 2
%   Y = B
% For our purpose we expected M to be 2.
% ?- variant(X,X).
%  No more !
% 
% ?- variant(f(a,_),f(a,_)).
% 
% Yes
% ?- variant(f(a,X),f(a,X)).
% No more !

% The right implementation for variant/2 has been a topic of discussion in the community.
% Thanks to Bart for making me aware of this alternative.
